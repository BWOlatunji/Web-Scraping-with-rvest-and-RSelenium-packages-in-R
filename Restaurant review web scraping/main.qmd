## Scraping Restaurant Reviews

-   Scrape delivery services -- Doordash, Uber Eats, and Postmates for a specific restaurant's rating and review data. For a pre-specified restaurant, we would like to be able to identify every location available for a given delivery service, and exhaustively scrape all available reviews (along with attendant meta-data such as location of review, date of review, text content of review, star rating, and so on).

-   Scraping other restaurant rating services not tied to delivery apps -- specifically Google Maps Reviews and Yelp -- for a pre-specified restaurant. Again, we would like specific review data and restaurant rating data from these services.

The final output should be a series of sqllite databases (.db files) for each scraped service containing appropriate tables to store the scraped content.
